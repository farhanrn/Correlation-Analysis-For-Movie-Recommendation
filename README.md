# Movie Correlation Analysis & Recommendation

This project analyzes movie correlations and provides recommendations based on patterns within the data. Using Python, this notebook leverages libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` to explore relationships between various movie attributes and suggest recommendations.

## Project Structure

- **movie_correlation_analysis_recommendation.ipynb**: The main notebook for performing analysis and generating recommendations.

## Requirements

The code requires the following packages:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install these using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook `movie_correlation_analysis_recommendation.ipynb`.
2. Run each cell to perform data loading, processing, analysis, and recommendation generation.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to visualize correlations and obtain movie recommendations.

## Data

The notebook expects a dataset containing movie information such as genres, ratings, and user preferences. Ensure the data is formatted correctly to match the notebookâ€™s requirements.

## Acknowledgments

This project utilizes open-source libraries and aims to demonstrate techniques in data science for movie recommendation systems.
